Defender prototype
==================

This is a prototype project to make a defender style game for the C256.

It is basically a playground where a simple game engine prototype is
intermixed with the actual game code.

The Calypsi-65816-Foenix board support package is used for C256 specific
definitions with the [Calypsi C compiler](https://www.calypsi.cc/).
